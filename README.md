# HTML
HTML page
It is just a basic HTML page.
I have created links in the first page that is main page of blog which can redirect to further pages. It's like a home page for a website.
And then in the basic folder there are three pages which can help in learning basics of html.
There is a page "Walk through your first html page".
In that there are most of the basics of HTML.

Further, I'll keep adding more information about HTML in the same Repository.
